            <h1>First Emperor Of China</h1>
            <p>The first emperor of China is generally considered to be Qin Shi Huang, who ruled from 221 BC to 210 BC. He was the founder of the Qin dynasty and is known for unifying China under a centralized imperial rule for the first time.

            Qin Shi Huang is also famous for his construction of the Great Wall of China and his ambitious public works projects. He implemented a standardized system of writing, currency, and measurements throughout his empire.
                
            He is also remembered for his brutal tactics in consolidating power, including the burning books and burying scholars alive who disagreed with him. Despite these controversial actions, Qin Shi Huang's reign laid the groundwork for many aspects of Chinese culture and governance that endure to this day.</p>

        <h1>Great Wall Of China</h1>
        <p>
            The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications that were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century BC,[4] with selective stretches later joined by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China.Little of the Qin wall remains.[5] Later on, many successive dynasties built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The best-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).
            Apart from defense, other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls, allowing the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade and the control of immigration and emigration.Furthermore, the defensive characteristics of the Great Wall were enhanced by the construction of watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and the fact that the path of the Great Wall also served as a transportation corridor.
