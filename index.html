            <h1>First Emperor Of China</h1>
            <p>The first emperor of China is generally considered to be Qin Shi Huang, who ruled from 221 BC to 210 BC. He was the founder of the Qin dynasty and is known for unifying China under a centralized imperial rule for the first time.

            Qin Shi Huang is also famous for his construction of the Great Wall of China and his ambitious public works projects. He implemented a standardized system of writing, currency, and measurements throughout his empire.
                
            He is also remembered for his brutal tactics in consolidating power, including the burning books and burying scholars alive who disagreed with him. Despite these controversial actions, Qin Shi Huang's reign laid the groundwork for many aspects of Chinese culture and governance that endure to this day.</p>
